My student code is 2542066
I had trouble with git at the start so the second Address class and Unit testing commit is the correct Address class and Unit testing commit.

To clarify, all methods are commented on what they do, all user-defined methods that can be tested are unit tested, all classes are finished and class diagram is here.
